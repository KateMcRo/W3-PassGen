# Random Password Generator

## Description

I wanted to randomly generate a password with specific attributes for greater security.
This project helped me explore JavaScript and allowed me to utilize prompts, functions, and strings.
The biggest takeaway for me was breaking things down into smaller parts and addressing them one at a time. Organization continues to be critical. 

## Usage

Click the red "Generate Password" button and respond to the prompts. If an error is given, try again. 
Once the selections are made correctly, a random password will be printed in the box as seen in the screenshot below.
